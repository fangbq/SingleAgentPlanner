# Single-Agent Planner

Single-Agent Planner is a complete epistemic planner without the epistemic closed world assumption for single agent which is logic-based. 

##Overview
This programme is a part of the reasearch on single-agent planner, and the research paper was published on [IJCAI 2015](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IJCAI/IJCAI15/paper/view/11109/11117).

Intuitively, the planner provide an agent with a series of algorithms so that the agent can interact with the enviroment, tack actions and get to the goal. BTW, all these are done in your pc, instead of entity.

##Structure
This planner could be divided into three parts:

####1. Parsing


####2. Reasoning

####3. Planning
